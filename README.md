# adventure-notes-api
An API for storing player and DM notes related to a role playing campaign.

## Core Ideas
* Support multiple adventures
* Support multiple users
* View the API from the point of view of either the DM or a specific character
* Each note designates a list of characters who know about the content
* Multiple note types:
  * Locations
  * Characters
  * Relationships (between/among characters)
  * Items
  * Sightings (characters or items seen in a specific location)
  * Events
  * Organizations
  * Quests
